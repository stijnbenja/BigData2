# Learning from Big Data (Assignment Module 2)

The problem that needs solving is trying to predict which products a customer will buy in a specific week (week 90) at a grocery store. We have to predict for each of the 2000 customers for each of the 250 products whether they will purchase them or not. Customers are also randomly given coupons of 10 to 40 percent in steps of 5, this will probably influence the chance of a customer buying the discounted product.
