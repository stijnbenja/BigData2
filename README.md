# Learning from Big Data (Assignment Module 2)

## 1. Introduction

#### a. Brief summary & research question
The problem that needs solving is trying to predict which products a customer will buy in a specific week (week 90) at a grocery store. We have to predict for each of the 2000 customers for each of the 250 products wether they will purchase them or not. Customers are also randomly given coupons of 10 to 40 percent in steps of 5, this will probably influence the chance of a cusomter buying the discounted product.

#### b. Problem relevation motivation




## 2. Problem formalization
#### a. What assumptions are necessary?
<ul> 
    <li>
    <li>
    <li>
</ul>

#### b. How well have you argued the reasonableness of your assumptions?  
#### c. Do you tackle the problem by supervised or unsupervised learning? 
The problem will be tackled using supervised learning as the training data is already labelled.

#### d. Do you need to post-process model predictions to derive your final results? 



## 3. Data (and descriptive analysis)
#### a.
